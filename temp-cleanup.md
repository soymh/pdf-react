## Cleanup Note

The old `/App.tsx` file in the root directory should be removed since we've moved the main App component to `/src/App.tsx` as per Vite conventions. This will prevent any import conflicts.

Files to remove:
- `/App.tsx` (root level - no longer needed)

The project structure is now properly organized with:
- `/src/App.tsx` - Main application component  
- `/src/main.tsx` - React bootstrap
- `/components/` - All React components
- `/styles/globals.css` - TailwindCSS v4 configuration
